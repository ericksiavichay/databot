2,Does Arize support batch models?,,,,"Yes, Arize supports batch models."
3,Does Arize support training data?,,,,"Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned whether Arize supports training data or not. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question."
4,How do I configure a threshold if my data has seasonality trends?,,,,"To configure a threshold for data with seasonality trends, you can use the automatic threshold feature provided by Arize. The automatic threshold sets a dynamic value for each data point based on at least 14 days of production data to determine a trend. This allows the threshold to adapt to the seasonal patterns in your data. Alternatively, you can also create a custom threshold and adjust it based on your understanding of the seasonality trends in your data."
5,How are clusters in the UMAP calculated? When are the clusters refreshed?,,,,"Clusters in UMAP are calculated using an unsupervised learning technique, which means that the algorithm finds patterns and structure in the data on its own.

27,Why does Arize use UMAP over t-SNE? ,,,,Arize uses UMAP over t-SNE because UMAP maintains both local and global structures in high-dimensional datasets and scales better than other dimension reduction techniques.
28,Can I export a dashboard as pdf? ,,,,I don't know.
29,How does Arize's surrogate explainability model work? ,,,,Arize's surrogate explainability model works by training an interpretable model to approximate the predictions of a black box model. This surrogate model is then used to generate SHAP values when the black box model is not available. The goal is to closely approximate the predictions of the black box model and generate feature importance values from the interpretable surrogate model.
30,Can I update my predictions or features on Arize? ,,,,"Based on the given context, it is not clear whether you can update your predictions or features on Arize."

Simply upload your actuals data using the same prediction_id as its corresponding prediction. The joiner will automatically trigger daily at 05:00 UTC to map the delayed actuals with the predictions received up to 14 days prior."
39,Can I pass in my own metrics within Arize?,,,,"Yes, Arize supports custom metrics, which allow users to define their own metrics tailored to their specific machine learning needs. These custom metrics can be used across the platform in dashboards, monitors, and performance tracing. Users can derive new metrics using a combination of existing model dimensions and functions using the Arize Query Language, which is similar to SQL. The custom metric editor provides syntax validation, auto-completion of dimension names, and a preview of the query before saving it."
40,How large should my file sizes be when uploading data? ,,,,Files around the 50MB mark usually provide the best balance between volume of data and system performance.
41,How long does it take to ingest my data? ,,,,It can take approximately 10 minutes for Arize to fully ingest and populate data throughout the platform.

What's going wrong?,,,,"It can take approximately 1 minute for the bar charts to appear and about 10 minutes for the data to fully load in the 'Data Ingestion' tab. If you have waited for this amount of time and the charts still do not show any data, there may be an issue with the data ingestion process. You can try refreshing the page or reaching out to Arize support for further assistance."
66,My monitor's latest status is green even though t he chart shows the threshold is crossed. What does this mean?,,,,"This means that the monitor's latest status is ""Healthy"" even though the chart shows that the threshold has been crossed."
67,What is a managed monitor?,,,,A managed monitor is a type of monitor that is automatically created and enabled based on default settings. It is used for monitoring a model and can be enabled from the 'Setup Monitors' tab. Managed monitors are created for all applicable features or dimensions and are based on a desired metric. They simplify the setup workflow and are suitable for first-time monitoring or trying out new metrics.
68,What is euclidean distance? I thought it is the distance between points. What does it mean on the page?,,,,"Euclidean distance is indeed the distance between points in a Euclidean space. In the given context, Euclidean distance is used as a metric to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between two sets of embeddings. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the components of two vectors. In the Arize platform, Euclidean distance is calculated using the original embeddings, not the UMAP projections. It can be used to monitor drift in embeddings by comparing the centroids of two sets of embeddings."
69,Can I deploy arize on my own kubernetes cluster?,,,,"Yes, you can deploy Arize on your own Kubernetes cluster."
70,How are the records sent to Arize secured?

However, the specific details of how Arize handles sensitive data are not provided in the given context."
71,Data ingestion page does not show the correct number of records,,,,"Check the data ingestion tab to see if the bar charts representing the volume of data received for predictions, actuals, and feature importance values match what is expected. Hover over the bars to ensure the volume is correct. If the data ingestion volume is as expected, perform a quick data ingestion check by verifying features and tags on the 'Overview' or 'Datasets' tab."
72,How do I link my actuals to predictions? ,,,,"To link your actuals to predictions, you can use the same prediction ID. By uploading your actuals data with the corresponding prediction ID, Arize can automatically connect the actuals to the predictions sent earlier. This can be done using the Arize joiner tool in the Arize platform."
73,Can I create one FileImporter job with both predictions and latent actuals? ,,,,"Yes, you can create one FileImporter job with both predictions and latent actuals if they can be sent together."
